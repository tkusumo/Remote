# Remote

This is a fun code exercise project from Remote. The remote app contains a database with 1000000 users. Each user has points that's updated every one minute by the server. There's also an API that will retrieve two users with points greater than max_number set by server.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Download or clone this repo
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) from your browser.
